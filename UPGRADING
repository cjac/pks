****! IMPORTANT !****

Several bugs were fixed in the 0.9.6 release, and so the database
format used in the keyserver is slightly different than in earlier
versions.

If you are upgrading from version 0.9.5 or earlier, you have two
choices:

1) Rebuild your database (i.e. dump the database using the old
   keyserver and then reload it using the new keyserver).

2) Keep your old database.  There is some wasted space as certain keys
   that were not indexed properly using the old keyserver will end up
   duplicated.

   To do this, you must build with ./configure --enable-old-database
