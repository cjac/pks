	timestamp bug.

2003-02-01  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks.init: Corrected the startup routine for pks-queue-run.sh. The
	init script was one argument -- the delay -- instead of the config file
	and the delay.

2003-02-01  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Committing "a patch to add basic dependencies to 
	Makefile.in for pks." The patch was submitted by Jason Harris.

2003-01-30  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

2003-01-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* kd_types.c (sigs_elem_order): Do not strip different signatures
	issued from the same keyid.  Do strip total duplicate signatures.

2003-01-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* kd_search.c (make_keys_elem): Fix a problem when multiple-subkey
	keys can cause the word index to not find the key.  The database
	was indexing on the subkey timestamp rather than the primary.

	* kd_index.c (keys_elem_genindex, keys_elem_genmrindex),
	kd_search.c (make_keys_elem), kd_types.h, kd_types.c
	(keys_elem_alloc, keys_elem_free): Simplify keytype storage to
	only keep track of the primary since that is what the user will
	see anyway.

2003-01-26  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* kd_search.c (v4_v3_keyid_transform, kd_output_wde): Do some
	magic to work around a bug in previous version of pksd.  The
	problem is that they calculated v4 RSA keyids as if they were v3,
	and stored them in the database that way.  So, in order to fix
	this, we catch cases where the actual keyid does not match the
	keyid that the database thinks we have and substitute what the
	database thinks.  Thus, key deletions work without leaving the
	database in an inconsistent state.  Eventually this function
	should be removed. ./configure --disable-keyid-transform disables
	this.

	* kd_index.c (keys_elem_genindex): Generate v4 fingerprints for
	all v4 keys.

	* kd_types.h, kd_types.c (keys_elem_alloc, keys_elem_free),
	kd_index.c (keys_elem_genindex, keys_elem_genmrindex), kd_search.c
	(make_keys_elem): Make keytype into an xbuffer so the subkey type
	does not override the primary type (which is the one we're really
	interested in).

	* pgputil.h, pgputil.c (generate_dsa_keyid): Rename to
	generate_v4_keyid.
	(decode_pubkey): Pass back version of the pk.  Generate v4 keyids
	for v4 keys.

	* configure.in: Add --disable-keyid-transform to turn off the
	backwards compatible v4->v3 RSA keyid transformation.

2003-01-25  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>
	
	* pks-mail.sh: Small files are still processed immediately. Large files
	are now left for pks-queue-run.sh. The idea behind this (and some of
	the code) were provided by Teun Njissen <teun.njissen@uvt.nl>.
 
	* pks-queue-run.sh: Small files are processed first with a small delay
	in between each file. Large files are processed second, with a larger
	delay in between each file. The idea behind this (and some of the code)
	were provided by Teun Njissen <teun.njissen@uvt.nl>.

2003-01-25  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* kd_search.h, kd_search.c (kd_keyblock_iterate, make_keys_elem):
	Disallow new subkey packets when we already have an existing
	subkey packet.  Disallow subkey revocation packets (pksd never
	supported them, and this at least prevents key corruption).  Note
	the "errorhack" is used to not display error messages except for
	an ADD: this is so servers with corrupt keys already in their
	databases do not fill up their logs complaining about this.

	* kd_add.c (kd_add_1), kd_search.c (kd_get_keys_by_keyid,
	do_all_keys): Change all callers to kd_keyblock_iterate to pass in
	the errorhack value.

2003-01-19  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* MRHKP: Adding David Shaw's e-mail (in mbox format) describing the
	machine-readable HKP format.
	
	* pks.spec: Added MRHKP as a documention file.

2003-01-17  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* multiplex.c: Now including time.h. This patch was provided by
	Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder <avbidder@fortytwo.ch>.
	
	* www.c: Now including arpa/inet.h. this patch was provided by
	Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder <avbidder@fortytwo.ch>.

2003-01-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* database.h, pks_www.c (pks_www): If options=mr is passed for a
	GET request, use content-type application/pgp-keys.  This is
	perhaps not optimal, as all key responses should really have this
	content type.  However, 99.9% of browsers out there won't know
	what to do with this type, so only use it when MR is requested.

2003-01-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* www.h, www.c (www_reply): Allow passing a content-type value to
	override the default text/html.  Change all callers.

	* pks_www.c (pks_www): Use a text/plain content type for
	machine-readable indexes.

2002-12-12  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* ChangeLog: Correcting Stephan J. Reichenbach's e-mail address in the
	first entry for 2002-12-11.
	
	* pks-commands.html.de: Adding changes by Stephan J. Reichenbach
	<stephan.reichenbach@web.de> to replace non-Roman charactesr with HTML
	entities. (This was done at my request to eliminate the few non-ASCII
	characters in the file.)

2002-12-11  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks-commands.html.de: Reworked the HTML a little to make it be
	closer to that of pks-commands.html.

2002-12-11  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks-commands.html.de: Adding German version of pks-commands.html.
	This translation was contributed by Stephan J. Reichenbach
	<stephan.reichenbach@web.de>.

2002-12-01  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* kd_search.c: Committed a patch to fix a memory leak. "[T]he db2
	cursor was not being closed in word_key_intersect()." the patch was
	provided by Nickolai Zeldovich <kolya@mit.edu>.

2002-11-25  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pksd.conf.5: Commited a (slightly modified) patch to correct the
	lack of documentation for the max_reply_keys configuration value. The
	patch was provided by Adrian 'Dagurashibanipal' von Bidder
	<avbidder@fortytwo.ch>.

2002-11-14  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* multiplex.c: Committed a patch to fix "another file descriptor
	pseudo-leak -- idle TCP connections weren't being timed out, and the
	code that claimed to do so in the existing implmentation didn't really
	work at all." The patch was provided by Nickolai Zeldovich
	<kolya@mit.edu>.

2002-11-11  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks_www.c: Committed a patch "to prevent a file descriptor leak".
	The patch was provided by Nickolai Zeldovich <kolya@mit.edu>.

2002-11-11  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* kd_delete.c: Committed a patch "to make consistency errors
	non-fatal". The patch was provided by Jason Harris
	<jharris@widomaker.com>.

2002-11-04  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks_config.c pks_config.h pks_www.c pks_www.h pksd.c www.c www.h:
	Commited patch to allow pksd to bind to a specific IP address. The
	patch was provided by Jonathan McDowell <noodles@earth.li>.
	
2002-11-04  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Committed patch to fix another issue with the Makefile.
	patch was provided by Jonathon Weiss <jsweiss@mit.edu>.

2002-10-20  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Committed patch to fix an issue with make install. The
	patch was provided by Jonathon Weiss <jweiss@mit.edu>.

2002-10-08  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Committed patch to only install SYSCONF files if the
	file does not already exist. The original patch was written by
	Christoph Martin <martin@uni-mainz.de>. I applied the change to
	Makefile.in rather than Makefile.

2002-10-08  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* database.h, kd_index.c (userids_elem_genmrindex,
	keys_elem_genmrindex, kd_index_1), pks_www.c (pks_www):
	Machine-readable index format for easy nonhuman parsing.

2002-09-29  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks-commands.html.ja: Added Japanese translation of
	pks-commands.html. The translation was done by Hironobu Suzuki
	<hironobu@h2np.net>.

2002-09-29  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Added $(ALL_SUPERUSER) to the list of things to remove
	on a "make clean". I forgot this before.

2002-09-29  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks.spec: Added a revised description. (I made some modifications to
	the description proved by Inaki Arenaza <iarenaza@escomposlinux.org>.)

2002-09-29  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: pks-commands.html is now installed in localstatedir as
	index.html to allow for direct web queries (no need for an external
	HTTP server to handle the HTML Forms page)
	
	* mkpksdconf.in: added www_dir option
	
	* pks-commands: Removed "http://localhost:11371/" from URLs
	
	* pks.spec: updated for pks-commands.html installation change
	
	* pksconfig.h: added www_dir option
	
	* pks_www.c: Using www_dir instead of db_dir for the location of
	index.html. Also, log_error is called instead of log_fatal if the
	homepage can't be loaded.
	
	* pks_www.h: added www_dir option
	
	* pksd.c: added www_dir option

2002-09-29  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* db2-sleepycat/dist/Makefile.in: Changed RPM_BUILD_DIR to DESTDIR.
	I missed this with the change to the pks Makefile.in.

2002-09-28  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: Changed RPM_BUILD_DIR to DESTDIR. There's no need to
	have RPM hard-coded in there. The Debian package will use this
	variable, too. Also, I added an INSTALL_SCRIPT variable. This is so
	that we can more easily merge the NetBSD patch-aa.
	
	* pks.spec: Changed RPM_BUILD_DIR to DESTDIR. This was done to reflect
	the changes in Makefile.in, of course.

2002-09-28  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* kd_search.c: I added a patch by Marc Horowitz that fixes a buffer
	overflow with long user IDs.
	
	* multiplex.c: I added a patch by Nickolai Zeldovich <kolya@mit.edu>
	that makes some FDs non-blocking. This has fixed regular pksd hangs
	for the guys at MIT.
	
	* pkscheck.c: I added a patch that does some memory initialization.
	(This patch came from the pks distribution that is being used at MIT.)

2002-09-28  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* ChangeLog: added my e-mail address to two entries that lacked it
	
	* NEWS: Updated to reflect the upcoming 0.9.5 release.
	
	* globals.h: Updated to reflect the upcoming 0.9.5 release.

2002-09-27  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks.init: I changed the test for the config file to use the file as
	specified in the CONFIG variable, instead of /etc/pksd.conf. Also,
	I set the chmod command on pksd_socket to use the right path.
	
	* pks.spec: Fixed a typo on a date in the changelog section. Removed
	the code that creates the sbin directory. (The Makefile does this now.)
	The buildroot is now under %{_tmppath} so that the RPMs can be built
	as a normal user. The code that checks for an existing database and
	creates one if needed now uses the correct path. The database is now
	permissioned properly. Error output due to a user already existing is
	suppressed when useradd is called.

2002-09-25  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Makefile.in: pksd is now placed in the sbindir instead of the bindir
	
	* pks.spec: the spec file was updated to reflect that the Makefile now
	places pksd in the sbindir instead of the bindir

2002-09-25  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks-commands.html: Added pks-commands.html. (I found this in the
	Debian package of pks.)
	
	* Makefile.in: Added pks-commands.html to the list of DATA files.

2002-09-25  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks_help.es: Added Spanish help file updates by Inaki Arenaza
	<iarenaza@escomposlinux.org>.

2002-09-24  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks_config.c: Added patch by Inaki Arenaza
	<iarenaza@escomposlinux.org> to fix a bug involing the lack of strict
	token matching for max_last_reply_keys.

2002-09-23  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pksd.c: added db_dir option (from NetBSD patch-ab)
	
	* pks_www.c: added homepage_str code (from NetBSD patch-ac)
	
	* pks_www.h: added db_dir option (from NetBSD patch-ad)

2002-09-23  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* www.c: Added a patch by Jason Harris. (I tweaked some asthetic
	issues that I had with the patch, but that's it.) ECONNABORTED,
	EINTR, and EPROTO are all handled errors for the accept() call.
	Each of the errno values are wrapped in #ifdef...#endif to prevent
	compilation failures if they aren't defined.

2002-09-14  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* mail_intro: removed "format=flowed" from the MIME header, at Marcel
	Waldvogel's <marcel@wanda.ch> request.

2002-09-13  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* mail_intro: Added MIME header. (Patch from Marcel Waldvogel
	<marcel@wanda.ch>.)
	
	* pks.spec: Documentation changes. (Patch from Marcel.)
	
	* Makefile.in: Documentation changes. (Patch from Marcel.)

2002-09-12  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks_help.dk pks_help.en pks_help.fr pks_help.fi pks_help.es 
	pks_help.no: Updated list of keys.??.pgp.net, according to Jason Harris 
	<jharris@widomaker.com>. (Basically, I removed the keys.fi.pgp.net and 
	keys.no.pgp.net entries.)

2002-09-12  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* pks_help.dk pks_help.en pks_help.fr pks_help.fi pks_help.es 
	pks_help.no: Added/changed according to the versions from Marcel 
	Waldvogel <marcel@wanda.ch>.
	
	* mail_send.c (mail_send): Added a patch from Marcel that "tries to 
	open the default language file when the specified help language was not 
	found. [I also deleted the default language helpfile caching, as (1) 
	the fallback to the default language could not easily take advantage of 
	teh caching, (2) the caching does not seem useful in terms of speed 
	gain, and (3) it would require a restart of pksd when the language 
	files were changed.]".

2002-09-10  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* Adding pks_help.en and pks_help.de from Marcel Waldvogel

	* pks.spec: Changed /var/lib/pks/db to /var/lib/pks. Bug fix suggested

	* pks.spec: MAJOR CHANGES: The spec file was radically updated for the
	upcoming pks-0.9.5rc1. I made a couple of non-backwards-compatible
	changes. The database is now stored in /var/lib/pks instead of
	/home/keyserver. (This was done for FHS compliance.) The PREFIX is now
	/usr instead of /usr/local. For more details, see the %changelog that 
	is within the spec file itself.

	configuration options is now consistent

2002-09-08  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* kvcv.c (kvcv): errors with decode_userid are now logged as
	"decode_userid" instead of "decode_pubkey"

2002-09-08  Richard Laager  <rlaager@bigfoot.com>

	* kd_index.c (keys_elem_genindex): Missed bit of the beauty patch.

2002-09-05  M. Drew Streib  <dtype@dtype.org>

	* applied elements of the beauty patch, sans the fingerprinting
	changes in kd_index that david already updated

	* Somewhat fixed distclean to actually work, although it doesn't
	automatically do a 'make clean' anymore. For now, a 
	'make clean distclean' will take care of things properly, where
	before it didn't work at all.

2002-09-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* multiplex.c (mp_write): Nickolai Zeldovich's fix for garbage
	mixed in with large keys.

	* kd_search.c (parse_keyidstr): Do not error on too large keyids,
	but rather shrink them until they are the correct size.  This is
	to allow a graceful change to allowing 16-digit or full
	fingerprint requests in a future version.

	* armor.c: Put actual pksd version in Version: string.
